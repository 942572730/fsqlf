I use debian, so I describe what I did. Your system probably is different, but at maybe this will at least give you an idea in which direction to go.


####
## System preparation



Install WxWidgets needs to be installed
(http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Installing_and_configuring_under_Ubuntu)

  # apt-get install wx2.8-headers libwxgtk2.8-0 libwxgtk2.8-dev
  # cd /usr/include
  # ls | grep wx
  # ln -sv wx-2.8/wx wx



####
## System preparation for compiling windows binaries




Install mingw (cross) compiler
  # apt-get install mingw32

Download WxWidgets source from http://www.wxwidgets.org/
(some forums mention that sources provided by ubuntu/debian are not good)

Build WxWidgets with mingw
  # ./configure --prefix=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc --host=i586-mingw32msvc --build=`./config.guess` --enable-unicode --disable-shared
  # make
  # make install
  # cd /usr/i586-mingw32msvc/include
  # ln -sv wx-2.8/wx wx
