Free SQL Formatter

3. Current TODO list
4. Usage



1. Compilation
1.1 Compilation process: 
make all #This compiles source for LINUX and WINDOWS (requires mingw)
make test # compiles LINUX version and runs program on test file


1.2 Requirements for compilation:
To successfully compile you will need following programs installed:
	flex, gcc, make, mingw cross compiler (for compiling windows binaries)




2. Current state
`fsqlf' can allready be used.
My use case is formating generated SQL code (making readable one line of code that actualy should be 300 lines)




3. Current TODO lists:
basic - to have working version 1
- `in' statements [done] 
- comments one line [done]
- comments multiline [done]
- strings [done]

extention #1 - more comfortable usage (next level)
- formating configurations
- reading command line arguments
- GUI

extension #2 - better formating
- `case' statements (redo stack functions; add handling)
- analytical functions

possible extra functionality/ideas for the future
- in equality condition align all comparison signs ('=' , '<>', etc.)
- align comments them selfs and content of comments



4. Usage
currently only supported from from command line (`command prompt' `cmd.exe' in windows)

window
  fsqlf.exe < input_file.sql > output_file.sql

linux
  fsqlf < input_file.sql > output_file.sql

("input_file.sql" and "output_file.sql" are ofcourse filenames of you chosing)
