1. Compilation
2. Current state
3. Current TODO list





1. Compilation
> make all #This compiles source for LINUX and WINDOWS (requires mingw)
> make test # compiles LINUX version and runs program on test file



2. Current state
Though there are two tasks still left on the TODO basic list, formatter seems usable.
My usecases are making long generated SQL code readable



3. Current TODO lists:
basic - to have working version 1
- `case' statements (redo stack functions; add handling)
- `in' statements [done] 
- comments one line [done]
- comments multiline [done]
- strings [done]
- analytical functions

extention - more comfortable usage (next level)
- formating configurations
- reading command line arguments
- GUI

future rewrite? - possible extra functionality (even more `next' level, which probably would need a rewrite of big part)
- in equality condition align all comparison signs ('=' , '<>', etc.)
- align comments them selfs and content of comments
